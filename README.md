# api-project
Spring 2022 API project for MIS 2402: SAT Data in New York City schools.

The purpose of this project is to cumulatively test web development students on the skills learned in MIS 2402. In this project, students are to create an application that pulls information from public data sets, and builds any selected chart type. This particular application pulls mean SAT scores from schools across New York and returns a chart that shows the relationship between the number of test takers sent by a school and their respective Math SAT score (Using a line chart API). This application also shows the average of each school's SAT scores (using a bar chart API), in effort to see if students excelled in any particular section on the sat in the city of new york. Both charts are created with the Image Charts API. 

Conclusion: 
Based off of the results in the application, there appears to be a general trend that, as the number of test takers sent by a school increases, so does the average Math SAT score. There are many potential confounding variables as to why this is the trend, since simply sending more students may be indicative of other factors such as larger school funding. Though some schools did perform better than others, students typically did not excel in any particular section of the SAT as the averages of each section across the city of new york were roughly equal.
